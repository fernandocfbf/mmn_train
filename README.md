# Measuring Macronutrients Training

-> Status: development ⚠️

# QUICK START
Start by downloading the required libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you pretend to use your own dataset, change the src/roboflow.py and add your own dataset URL for roboflow.
Then run:

```
python src/download_data.py
```

Else you can use the pre uploaded data, located at: src/data.zip. Just remember to unzip the file.
